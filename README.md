# Harvard's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my coursework and solutions for Harvard University's CS50x course, which I completed in 2023. It includes my work on problem sets covering topics from C and Python to SQL and web development.

## The Role of the CS50 Library

Many of the C programs in the earlier weeks rely on a special `cs50.h` library provided by the course. This library includes custom data types (like `string`) and functions to simplify the learning process for beginners. As a result, the code in these folders is not designed to be compiled in a standard environment but works perfectly within the CS50 ecosystem where it was written.

## Highlighted Projects

While this repository contains all my weekly assignments, the projects below are the ones I'm most proud of. They showcase my ability to tackle complex logical problems.

### 1. Tideman (Week 3)
* **Location:** `/wk3/tideman/`
* **Description:** This was a notoriously challenging C program designed to simulate the "Tideman" voting method. The goal was to take voter preferences, represent them in a graph, and determine the winner without creating cycles in the graph.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Algorithmic thinking, recursion, data structures (graphs), and complex logical problem-solving. This project required careful debugging and a systematic approach to tracing the flow of data.

### 2. Speller (Week 5)
* **Location:** `/wk5/speller/`
* **Description:** A program in C that loads a dictionary into memory using a hash table and then checks a piece of text for spelling errors.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Understanding and implementing hash tables, memory management in C, and performance optimization.

//TODO: add depth/breadth-first search to tideman description
