# Harvard's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my coursework and solutions for Harvard University's CS50x course, which I completed in 2023. It includes my work on problem sets covering topics from C and Python to SQL and web development.

## The Role of the CS50 Library

Many of the C programs in the earlier weeks rely on a special `cs50.h` library provided by the course. This library includes custom data types (like `string`) and functions to simplify the learning process for beginners. As a result, the code in these folders is not designed to be compiled in a standard environment but works perfectly within the CS50 ecosystem where it was written.

## Highlighted Projects

While this repository contains all my weekly assignments, the projects below are the ones I'm most proud of. They showcase my ability to tackle complex logical problems.

### 1. Tideman (Week 3)
* **Location:** [wk3/tideman/tideman.c](https://github.com/lukegail/CS50-110647156/blob/main/wk3/tideman/tideman.c)
* **Description:** This program simulates the "Tideman" ranked-pairs voting method. The core challenge was to lock in pairs of candidates to a directed graph without creating cycles. To solve this, I implemented a recursive depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to detect cycles before locking in an edge.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Algorithmic thinking (recursion, depth-first search), data structures (directed graphs), complex logical problem-solving, and systematic debugging.

### 2. Speller (Week 5)
* **Location:** `/wk5/speller/`
* **Description:** A program in C that loads a dictionary into memory using a hash table and then checks a piece of text for spelling errors.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** Understanding and implementing hash tables, memory management in C, and performance optimization.

//TODO: fix locations

//TODO: add depth/breadth-first search to tideman description
